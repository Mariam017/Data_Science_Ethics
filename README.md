# Data_Science_Ethics

This is where I record data ethics notes as I go along my learning journey.
1-Data Ethics/Race
 It's important to note that segmenting customers by race (or any other demographic group) for the purpose of lending is illegal in the United States.
The same thing might be legal elsewhere, but even if it is, making decisions for things like lending based on racial categories is clearly unethical.
This is a great example of how easy it can be to use data science tools to support and propagate systems of inequality. Even though we're "just" using numbers, 
statistical analysis is never neutral, so we always need to be thinking critically about how our work will be interpreted by the end-user.(WorldQuantUniversityDataScienceLab)
